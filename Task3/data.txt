Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language. Node is sometimes referred to as a programming language or software development framework, but neither is true; it is strictly a JavaScript runtime.
